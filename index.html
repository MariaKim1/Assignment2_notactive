            Should I use class here instead?-->

                <p class="favourite snacks">It is impossible to do coding without snacking. My favourite things to snack on are cookies, 
                chocolate and sour candies. You should really try the pink and blue chewy fizzy bottles, they're addictive!</p>
                
                <p class="snack info">You can buy fizzy bottles at the candy store!</p>

        <!--I thought I figured it out but I'm not sure when to use section vs <div> vs <class>? 
            In the CSS video fromo assignment 2 M says that we can only use section id once per page..?
            Did I understand it right? Bcs it makes things harder for me hehe..-->
